<p style="font-size: 14px;">Ask me anything about the data such as the following:</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">Filtering and sorting:</p>
     <style>
     ul li {
       font-size: 14px; /* Or any other desired size */
     }
     </style>
     <ul>
       <li>Filter the data and show the fastest 3 runners for each year earning a bronze buckle.</li>
       <li>List international runners without a DNF ordered by finish time.</li>
     </ul>
     
<p style="font-size: 14px;">Questions:</p>
     <style>
     ul li {
       font-size: 14px; /* Or any other desired size */
     }
     </style>
     <ul>
       <li>What was the average age of runners who got a silver buckle each year?</li>
       <li>If a runner made it to Foresthill between 14 and 15 hours, how likely were they to get a silver buckle?</li>
       <li>What was the average time at Robinson Flat for runners who arrived at Foresthill between 17 and 18 hours and finished the race?</li>
    </ul>

<p style="font-size: 14px;">A black dot below or at the end of the last answer means I'm still responding. I am a large language model so experimentation, retries and patience are required.</p>
